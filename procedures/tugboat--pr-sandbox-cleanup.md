If our disk allowance runs out, PR sandboxes fail to be generated. The process to free some space to allow PR sandboxes to be created again is as follows:

1. Go to https://dashboard.tugboat.qa/5f9cffcf6c879bf4534e573e
2. For each preview older than X, click Actions > Delete > Yes
   - X is an appropriate time ago, based on the number of previews and how recent they are (e.g. the ones that are 6-9 months old)
   - If there is a flurry of activity, you may need to delete all previews older than 3 months, just to get us back under quota.

People with access to that Tugboat project currently are:
- Nate (@quicksketch)
- Jen (@jenlampton)
- Peter (@BWPanda)
- Greg (@klonos)
- Dragon Bot
