Adding a new Core committer
===========================

When a mew core committer is added to the team, there are a number of places
they need to be included, and things that need to be udpated, as follows:

1) Update the leadership page backdropcms.org/leadership so that everybody knows
   that they are a core committer.

2) Add the new person to the backdrop/backdrop repository, so that they can have
   commit access to core code.

3) Add the new person to the backdrop-ops/leadership repository, so that they
   can have access to all the issues where PMC + Core committers collaborate.

4) Add the person's preferred email address to the core commiter group email
   forwarding, set up at NameCheap.

5) (Until we choose a better chat tool that integrates with GitHub)
   5a) Manually add the new person to the private "Core committers" chat channel.
   5b) Manually add the new person to the private "Leadership" chat channel.
